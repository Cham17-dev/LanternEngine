Lantern Engine runs your own copy of Bloodborne on Windows: a launcher and my engine, built on bbport and shadPS4 and reworked by me for performance. The game's own code runs natively on your CPU; its graphics are translated to Vulkan.

> **Note:** I'm keeping this going on my own, and updates are slower now because of the hate I've been getting. I'll keep working on it when I can.

**No game files are included.** You need your own decrypted Bloodborne dump (CUSA03173) with update 1.09.

## Install

1. Download `LanternEngine-<version>-win64.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/Awakenchan/LanternEngine/releases) and extract it anywhere.
2. Run `Lantern Engine.exe` and pick your game folder (the one with `eboot.bin`).
3. Press **Play**. The launcher updates itself. `Bloodborne.exe` starts the game directly (add it to Steam as a non-Steam game).
